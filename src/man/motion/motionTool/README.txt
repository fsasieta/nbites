This directory contains the C++ classes that help the tool
communicate with the robot and control its motions from the computer.


I put the files relating to the tool in a different directory in motion
because these files do not actually relate to the autonomous behavior of the
robot, but rather the behavior input form the user through the tool.
Basically I did not want to confuse future people that may see this later on.
AKA next generation northern bites.
